### 1. Getting Access

To get started, you'll need access to the following:

- **GitHub:** Our code is hosted here. Please send your GitHub username to your manager for repo access.
- **Docker Hub:** We use Docker Hub for container images. Share your Docker ID for team access.
- **GCP, AWS, and DigitalOcean:** We use multiple cloud providers, so reach out for access to our resources as needed.
- **Slack (or preferred team communication tool):** For company and team communication.
- **Documentation tools (Confluence, Notion, etc.):** Request access if needed.

### 2. Setting Up Your Development Environment

#### 2.1 Clone the Repositories

1. **Clone the main repository** (and any additional ones as directed by your manager).
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourCompany]/[MainRepo].git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - **npm:** Run `npm install` where applicable for frontend projects.
   - **Docker:** Pull Docker images or build them locally.

#### 2.2 Set Up Docker

We use Docker extensively for development, staging, and production environments.

- Ensure Docker is installed and running.
- **Pull development images:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

#### 2.3 Configure Environment Variables

1. **Environment Files:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update any secrets.
2. **Secrets Management:** We use [GCP Secret Manager/AWS Secrets Manager] (depending on your stack) to securely store and access sensitive information.

### 3. Tech Stack Overview

#### Backend

- **Languages:** Rust, Python
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ for queueing
- **Cloud Services:** GCP (primary), AWS (for SES, S3), DigitalOcean (for backup or specific services)

#### Frontend

- **Framework:** ReactJS
- **Package Manager:** npm (pnpm or Yarn if preferred by the team)

#### DevOps

- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for managing our containerized applications

---

### 4. Working with Repositories

We follow a **feature-branch workflow**:

1. **Create a branch** for new features or bug fixes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Push your changes** and open a **Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub.
3. **PR Reviews:** All PRs require at least one review. Make sure your PR includes meaningful commits and messages.

---

### 5. Deployment and Environments

- **Development:** Local environment with Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Staging:** Managed with Kubernetes and deployed to our staging cluster in GCP.
- **Production:** Kubernetes cluster in GCP, with automated deployments via GitHub Actions.

#### Deployment Process

1. Merge changes to the `main` branch for deployment.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions will automatically build, test, and deploy the application to the specified environment.

### 6. Common Tools and Practices

#### Docker and Docker Compose

- **Docker Hub:** All public/private images are available at [Your Docker Hub URL].
- Run `docker-compose up` for local development setup.

#### Kubernetes

We use Kubernetes clusters for production and staging environments, with resources managed by Helm charts. You'll need access to `kubectl` to monitor the clusters.

#### Database Management

- **PostgreSQL:** Access databases through [pgAdmin/other preferred tools]. Make sure to follow our migration guidelines when updating schemas.
- **Redis:** Used primarily for caching. Access via CLI or Redis GUI if needed.

#### Message Queues and Email

- **RabbitMQ:** Used for handling async tasks. Use the RabbitMQ dashboard for monitoring.
- **SES:** For email functionality. Credentials are available in your environment configuration.

### 7. Company Culture and Communication

- **Daily Standups:** We have quick standups to check in on daily progress and blockers.
- **Slack Channels:** Use specific channels for queries (#frontend, #backend, etc.)
- **Documentation:** Update documentation when you work on new features or processes.

### 8. Additional Resources

- **API Documentation:** Refer to [API documentation URL] for REST and GraphQL endpoint details.
- **Code Style Guides:** Refer to our [JavaScript/Rust/Python] guidelines in the repo.
- **Onboarding Checklist:** Complete the onboarding checklist available in [Project Management Tool/Notion].
