# Copy everything ginger-auth generated into the shared creds workspace.
# IMPORTANT: files in the workspace are read by other containers (the runner
# step) which may run as a different user. Set permissions explicitly:
#   - Private key: 644 (not 600) so other users can read it.
#     The runner copies it to its own ~/.ssh/ and sets 600 there.
#     A 600 file owned by a different UID is unreadable by the runner.
#   - Everything else: 644 (standard readable).
